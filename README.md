# Second Brain

Welcome to **Second Brain**, my personal repository for keeping notes on technologies I’m learning. The goal is to have a single place where I can quickly refer to key concepts, commands, and tips while studying or working on projects.

Even though this is primarily for my own reference, I have made it public in case it can help someone else along the way.

- [SQL](SQL/00%20SQL%20Index.md)
- [Bash Scripting](00%20Table%20of%20Contents)

Happy learning! 🚀
